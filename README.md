# Analysis of Titanic Data Using Numpy and Pandas
In this project, I'll be exploring a Kaggle dataset on 891 Titanic passengers. The biggest question I could ask of this dataset is: **What were the most likely factors for survival?** By the end of this notebook, I'll suggest a simple heuristic based on some of these factors that aims to make a tentative prediction. This heuristic is merely a sanity check and by no means a conclusive predictor for survival. Along the way, I'll explore some other questions that come up as I perform the analysis, such as:

 * How do we deal with missing data?
 * Are higher class tickets necessarily more expensive?
 * How are survival factors interrelated?

among others.
